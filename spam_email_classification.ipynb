       " 'Subject: message subject\\nthink getting a 1 . 95 % rate is impossible ?\\nthink again !\\nwe can offer you the absolute rock - bottom lowest rate , guaranteed .\\nwe work with all credit types . visit our site now , for your rate quote .\\nclick here now !\\nnow that i have had both services , and having noticed that a google search\\nyields no definitive answers for people , i wanted to post my personal review\\nof the two systems .\\ni have an alpine cda - 7878 and an alpine xm unit and a panasonic sirius unit ,\\nboth with terk antennas . the alpine unit was connected to the head unit via\\nan ainet cable and the sirius unit was connected with an auxiliary rca\\nadapter available from alpine ( kca - 121 b ) . i had xm since it debuted and\\nsirius for a few months in the pacific northwest .\\nthe bottom line , for those needing a quick answer , is sirius is superior in\\nsound quality , features ( free streaming from their website ! ) , and channel\\nquality ( better music , no commercials , better talk ) . xm has a few more\\nchannels that make very little difference to the end result ( read on ) .\\nafter careful review of both systems , sirius came out the winnner , as i have\\nsaid . the channels are laid out well , lack commercials , sound great , and\\nare streamed on the internet . the only disadvantage of sirius was its\\noft - sited lack of nascar , which they seem to be trying to remedy . also , xm\\nhas an extra comedy channel ( it \\' s boring , and features older , censored\\ncomedy ) , and a few more \" experimental \" music channels which most will find\\ntotally useless . surfing xm for music is often like surfing the regular\\n( terrestrial ) radio in a large city - you get nothing but frustration . it \\' s\\nno wonder xm doesn \\' t stream live on the net so that you can try before you\\nbuy . also , xm \\' s channel layout was unfriendly , in my opinion .\\nthe greatest and most dizzying drawback in comparing the two , however , are\\nthe staggeringly stupid and annoying xm commercials . not necessarily the\\ncorporate commercials that come from outside companies ( which are annoying\\nin an expected way ) , but the ridiculous and loud in - house xm stuff that\\nmakes you have to turn down your radio really quick when you \\' ve had it up\\nloud - especially with the windows open ( yes , they are that embarrassing ) .\\nthis , and the better performance of sirius , was the deciding factor in my\\ncancelling xm .\\nxm , however , holds their own and can satisfy a customer with some decent\\nmusic and a fair selection of talk . if not for sirius , i would have kept\\nxm , i think ; probably because it is nice to listen to the same station no\\nmatter where you go . yet , as is the way of competition , sirius has offered\\neverything good that xm does and done it right . sirius outshines in the\\ntalk category , with a variety of right and left - wing shows , all of the\\nuseful talk channels xm has , and npr , pri , and a well laid - out channel plan .\\nxm does a bit better in the design of their customer care website . sirius\\nalso has a customer care website , but it is not as robust ( less detail ) .\\nhowever , xm doesn \\' t have streaming audio on its website - apparently we all\\nhave to pay xm $ 6 . 99 extra in additon to buying another $ 200 receiver for\\nthe house . in addition to the crappy commercials , this is probably where\\nthe corporate influence of xm being part - owned by clearchannel and gm shows .',\n",
